# Simple framework

## Why?
I just wanted to experiment with the idea of making a framework where i could get more granular control over how a component is rendered, but also have modern ideas like stateful & stateless components etc.

## Features
* Small <small>(1.83KB w/ all classes imported)</small>
* Stateful & Stateless components
* Smart utilization of DOM
    * innerText when the contents is just text
    * innerHTML when it requires HTML parsing
* Modular
* Typescript definitions

## TODO
* Utilize a bundler
* Write a basic application with it
* Come up with a name
* Simplify any pain points
