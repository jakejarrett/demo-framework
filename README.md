# Simple framework

## Why?
I just wanted to experiment with the idea of making a framework where i could get more granular control over how a component is rendered, but also have modern ideas like stateful & stateless components etc.

## Features
* Small
* Stateful & Stateless components
* Smart utilization of DOM
    * innerText when the contents is just text
    * innerHTML when it requires HTML parsing
* Modular
    * Utilizes "open for extension, closed for modification" principle
* Typescript definitions

## TODO
* Write a basic application with it
* Come up with a name
* Simplify any pain points

## Inspirations for this framework
* Backbone
* React & React Native
* Preact
* Choo
* Polymer
